#Note:
Please add External JARS for Cucumber and Selenium before executing,I didnt add the dependencies in POM.xml

Suggestions to Improve Test:
Ask the people who are taking up to Test to design Hybrid framework which includes POM or Data Driven and BDD
Add more complexity both in Java part as well as Selenium part(Ex:Collection in Java,Dynamic Tables in Selenium)
Add some more scenrios where we can use Javascript as well,I didnt get the chance to use it anywhere in the test
Ask to congifure in Jenkins
